# Multiturn-PDF-Chatbot-with-Prompt-Template

## Task 2- Development of a Multi-Turn Streamlit Chatbot.
## Problem Statement:
Our primary objective is to develop a Streamlit-based chatbot application that leverages the OpenAI API. This application empowers users to engage in meaningful interactions with textual content extracted from uploaded PDF documents. The central focus of this project is to enable multi-turn conversations with the chatbot while ensuring the preservation of conversation context and history. This functionality is designed to facilitate seamless and interactive information retrieval.
## Functional Requirements:
To meet this objective, the following functional requirements have been identified:
- Multi-turn Conversation:
The chatbot must support multi-turn conversations, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and maintain a continuous dialogue. This functionality requires the chatbot to remember the context throughout the conversation, ensuring that interactions feel natural and coherent.
- Context Preservation:
The chatbot is required to retain context from prior interactions, including previous questions and responses. This feature enables the chatbot to engage intelligently in a conversation, taking into account what has been discussed earlier.
- Defining Conversation Boundaries:
The application should define clear starting and ending points for each interaction with the chatbot. This practice is essential for effectively structuring and managing the flow of communication, resulting in well-organized and coherent conversations.
## Optional Tasks:
- Implementing a Knowledge Graph:
Consider adding the capability to implement a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph would organize and represent information in a structured manner, enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide informed and context-aware responses.
